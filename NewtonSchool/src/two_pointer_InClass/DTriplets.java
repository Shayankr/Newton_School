//Problem Statement
//Given an array Arr[] of size N, your task is to count the number of triplets Arr[i], Arr[j] and Arr[k] 
//such that:- i < j < k and the difference between every 2 elements of triplets is less than or equal to P
//i. e |Arr[i] - Arr[j]| <= P, |Arr[i] - Arr[k]| <= P and |Arr[j] - Arr[k]| <= P

//Input
//The first line of input contains two space- separated integers N and P 
//The next line of input contains N space separated integers depicting the values of the Arr[].

//Output
//Return the count of triplets that satisfies the above conditions.

public class DTriplets {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}

////Sample Input
//5 4
//1 3 2 5 9
//
////Output:
//4
//
//Explanation:-
//(1, 3, 2), (1, 3, 5), (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 5) are the required triplets
